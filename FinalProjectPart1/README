# this is the readme file for final project part 1

# i thought each time i was saving my file on pycharm, it was linking up to github but it wasn't
# so i just made multiple commits by pasting parts of the code each time before turning it in 

# i tried to get the sort date, and i tried some other stuff, not sure if it entirely works

# several def functions to sort for each thing asked, like full inventory, service dates, item types files, damaged inventory

# i opened each input file one at a time

# when writing to each csv file, i tried to get rid of the newline that appeared, but for some reason it's there
