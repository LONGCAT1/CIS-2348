Write a basic program that performs simple file and mathematical
operations.
a.
Write a program that reads dates from input, one date per line. Each
date's format must be as follows: March 1, 1990. Any date not following
that format is incorrect and should be ignored. Use the find() method to
parse the string and extract the date. The input ends with -1 on a line
alone. Use the datetime module to get the current date. Ignore any dates
that are later than the current date. Output each correct date as:
3/1/1990.
b.
After the program is working as above, modify the program so that it
reads all dates from an input file “inputDates.txt” (an Example file is
attached).
c.
Modify your program further so that after parsing all dates from the
input file “inputDates.txt”, it writes out the correct ones into an
output file called: “parsedDates.txt

first_space = 0
comma = 0
second_space = 0

day = 1
year = 1990

while date = input():
  if date[0].isalpha() == true:
    comma = date.find(',')
    first_space = date.find(' ')
    second_space = date.find(' ', first_space+1)
    day = date[comma-1:comma]
    year = date[second_space+1:len(date)]

    if date[0:first_space-1] == "January":
      month = 1
    elif date[0:first_space-1] == "Feburary":
      month = 2
    elif date[0:first_space-1] == "March":
      month = 3
